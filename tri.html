                              came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile 
                              and launch vehicle technology. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to
                               a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras

                                 Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. After graduating 
                                 from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
